TO DO LIST:

	split graphics, control and the rest even more
		--> Entities get a graphics part which will
				- lead to a static entity with empty methods if on the server side
				- execute the normal graphics part like spawning particles, containing the model and so on
		--> Player gets a control-Method which will be called by the singlePlayer and multiPlayer_Client
		--> The graphics part for the player will contain the displaying part of the inventory, too.
				so if you're on the server side, the inventory will still function normally, but won't be displayed
		--> TexturedModel etc. from the other project in more advanced
			* Entities get this ID only. If on client side, it'll be used to create the graphics part
			* if on server side, it'll just be sent to the client
	
	This all should be sufficient to run the server without issues. SinglePlayer *has* to work, too.
	If this is accomplished, then the server-client connection can be worked out without worries.
